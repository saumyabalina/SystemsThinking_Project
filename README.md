# SystemsThinking_Project

• Implemented the system dynamics of a 2-link manipulator in MATLAB.
• Developed and simulated Proportional-Derivative(PD), Proportional-Integral(PI), and Proportional-Integral-Derivative(PID) controllers.
• Utilized the given system parameters and parametric values for the simulation.
• Conducted comparative analyses by plotting joint angles (q1 and q2) vs. time (t) to showcase the differences in responses.
• Selected and tuned P, I, and D gains for each controller to achieve the objective of bringing joint angles to [0 0].
